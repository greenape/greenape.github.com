And I'm a PhD student, at the [University of Southampton](http://www.soton.ac.uk/). That doesn't tell you much, so I'll also say that I live in Social Statistics & Demography, and belong to the [Institute of Complex Systems Simulation](http://www.icss.soton.ac.uk/). I always feel like I should instantly confess to not actually being a statistician, or a demographer, because if I'm anything I'm really a computer scientist. My special interest is in agent based models of social systems, and more specifically applying decision theory to those agents. To be even more precise, those social systems are in the nebulous world of social care, as part of the (Care Lifecycle project)[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/clc]. Thus far, if we want to do this with laser-like precision, midwifery. And drunk people.

I spend a lot of time fiddling around in python, and slightly less crunching data in R. I like to cook, I ride a bike (not at the same time).

All good? Excellent.

You can look me up in places like [Google scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=IXr_IoUAAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/greenape), [ImpactStory](https://impactstory.org/JonathanGray), Southampton's [Computational Modelling Group](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/jg1g12/), and probably a few others.
