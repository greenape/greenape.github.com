For much of the last week, I have been at the excellent [SCCS](http://sccs2014.soton.ac.uk/) conference, in Brighton, organised by some of my more dynamic colleagues. SCCS is a sightly unusual conference, in that it is almost exclusively composed of PhD, and masters students, and early career researchers. The [abstracts](http://sccs2014.soton.ac.uk/downloads/Abstract_booklet_full.pdf) are worth checking out, and there was a lot of really interesting research being presented[^1].

I always feel a little intimidated when watching other people's talks. They all seem to know, with laser-like precision, exactly what they're doing, where their research is headed, and display a methodological and statistical jutsu that terrifies. The thing is, I know that that isn't entirely true for everybody[^2]. We just don't talk about the bits where we screw up, or spend six months working on something that turns out to a. not work, and b. was retrospectively never going to work.

The tendency to ignore, or not publish null or negative results is a [bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias) [of](http://www.scilogs.com/communication_breakdown/amsen-negative-results/) [a](http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/10/10/no-result-is-worthless-the-value-of-negative-results-in-science/) [problem](http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_what_doctors_don_t_know_about_the_drugs_they_prescribe). Related issues like the historic disinterest in [replication](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/02/results.aspx) studies, have had some [attention](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/) recently, and laudable things have come out of that, like the [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io), and substantial efforts to systematically replicate [psychological results](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/).

I gave a [talk](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/5374c639934283246b08edda) at SCCS14, which turned out to be about not thinking things through[^3]. Specifically, building a simulation that couldn't be validated, because there was no data to validate it against. I set out with a process that went "Ooo. This would be a cool way to build a simulation, there will obviously be data and I'll find it later.". More [#overlyhonestmethods](https://twitter.com/hashtag/overlyhonestmethods?src=hash)[^4], than null results, then. It was a bit of a shock to discover that the data didn't exist, and that I could essentially conclude only that different things behaved differently[^5].

It is quite possible, that I am the only person who has ever done this, but somehow I doubt it. So it seemed like a good idea to talk to people about how I'd screwed up so that they could avoid doing it in future. I tend to think that information sharing is not actually something the scientific community is very good at, partly because the constraints of a 7,000 word peer reviewed paper written in [good scholarly style](http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume2/v2i5/howto.htm) seriously limit what you have space to say. Giving a fullsome account of the things you mucked up en route just isn't possible, and probably isn't desirable in that context.

It will however be interesting to see what comes of recent calls for [open lab notebooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science). Perhaps I'm just a bad scientist? The only thing I can think of to do about that, is to acknowledge my mistakes, and try to learn from them.

[^3]: I only realised this was what is was about after I'd written it, and realised I'd glossed over my actual research.

[^4]: Overly honest methods was, if you ask me, a significant step forward for scientific communication.

[^5]: Sometimes.
