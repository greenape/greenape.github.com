Some time ago, I was sitting up in bed with my partner, having a conversation about her job (as one does). She works as a midwife, and was at the time finishing up her training and thinking about a topic for a dissertation. Something we both thought was interesting was how mental health interacts with midwifery practice. What really piqued *my* interest was an offhand remark that one of the really big challenges in dealing with patients with mental health issues is getting them to tell you they have them.

That was an interesting thought. Partly, because it involves secrets. Partly because the dynamic here is a little unusual - these kind of secrets potentially have large implication for health outcomes. But, telling a secret to one organ of the NHS, for example, actually represents telling the whole thing. In theory, if I tell one doctor at my GP that I've been hearing voices, then I'm telling all the other practitioners there as well. So, the next time I go, and see the practice nurse about my bunions, how she deals with me may well be influenced by this disclosure I've made to somebody else.

Still thinking about midwifery here, so why is it that people don't tell their midwife everything that might be relevant? There's a strong code of conduct to prevent information escaping the wider organisation. In fact in the UK, women hold their own medical notes for pregnancy, so disclosure is really quite limited. So why not tell them everything that might be important? A history of depression, for instance, is going to impact (or should do) the kind of support that gets made available.

The answer actually seems to be pretty obvious - there's a stigma attached to some of this stuff. If you do in fact hear voices, you might well keep that on the down low because of a concern about how people will treat you.

This starts to sound like a cost-benefit situation. There are benefits associated with disclosure, in terms of getting care that actually fits your needs. But, there's a cost, or the risk of a cost. You might get punished, in some social sense, for what you reveal.
Of course, not everybody has (that kind of) secret, and quite a few of the people who do are happy to tell it in the right context.

It seems like you could think of this like a game. (Not the fun kind, but one that could still lead to rows at christmas.)

So, let's call it the Disclosure Game, and I'll get into the actual details in another post.
